Meet the new WordPress User Interface for the non-tech end user

== Description ==

####SwiftySite
####The all-new User Interface for WordPress

Built for painters, plumbers, store-owners and soccer moms. 

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grd4pVINGPc]

From a blog to a website, an e-commerce solution or even a mobile app, WordPress allows people to create virtually anything. 

That's the beauty.   
And that's the problem.

In order to be everything to everybody, *the WordPress admin area has become an overwhelming and confusing dashboard with a 'million' options*. 

An alternative to WP would be to use one of the many *site builders* out there. Surely they are relatively easy to use. But they are also pretty limited. As opposed to WordPress, which is virtually unlimited in its possibilities. 

####SwiftySite combines the ease of use of a site builder with the raw, unlimited power of WordPress.

SwiftySite simplifies the way you:

1) design your website   
2) create pages   
3) fill those pages with content   

In fact, it is so easy that some people even call it: **"Wix for WordPress"**. But without the limitations.

But this also means...

####SwiftySite is not for everyone

SwiftySite is built - *from the ground up* - for people who may have never even heard of WordPress. It’s built for the end-user. 

 - For plumbers and painters.   
 - For store-owners and consultants.   
 - For the secretary of a law firm, that is asked to manage the website on the side.   
 - For the mom of the kid that plays soccer at the local soccer club who volunteered to take on the club’s website.   

So, yeah, this *WordPress simplifying plugin* is not for everyone. If you’re an advanced WordPress developer, you probably won’t like it. Though your clients might. But if you’re a website owner looking for an easy way to create a stunningly beautiful website, then **read on my friend! Cause you’re gonna love this ;-)**

####SwiftySite - WordPress for the rest of us.

You don't need technical skills to create a WordPress site with SwiftySite.   
You don't even have to know WordPress itself to create a WordPress site with SwiftySite!

Because SwiftySite is a like *a layer on top of WordPress*. 

***Think of SwiftySite as a car that has WordPress as the engine.***

Sure, you can pop the hood and have a look at the engine. But you don't have to. We hide the WordPress admin area for you. Not that you can't go there (Because you can. With a special switch). But for the most time, you don't *have* to go there anymore. 

Imagine for a moment that designing, creating and maintaining a WordPress website is as easy as sending an email or updating your Facebook status...

Now *that* would be something, wouldn't it?

We have managed to simplify most of the stuff you need for creating and maintaining your website. The stuff you use regularly.

But let's be honest, there is no way we could ever simplify all of it. Right?

I mean, there is so much you can do with WordPress… It's mind-blowing just to think about it. But the beauty of SwiftySite is that it is *fully two-way compatible with WordPress*.

This means you can always *switch from Swifty mode to regular WordPress mode*. Then do whatever you need to do there (install a plugin, adjust a shortcode, etc.), then switch back to Swifty mode and continue working on your day-to-day stuff.

***It just works!***

You will have the **ease of use** of SwiftySite for almost all your work and the **full power** or WordPress at your fingertips for those one or two special wishes you would like to see implemented on your website.

And if you are insecure about working in WordPress mode, **there's always a WordPress Professional that can help you** with that.

Just imagine the cost you can save by doing 95% of the work on your site yourself and only hire a pro for that special 5% you need done!

*SwiftySite empowers you to do just that.*

**So why not give it a try?** It's free :-)

Just go to the plugins page in your site's admin dashboard, click the New Plugin button and search for SwiftySite in the search box on the right. Click install now and activate. Or follow these [instructions](https://wordpress.org/plugins/swifty-site/installation/).

*We'll see you on the other side!*

####This is how we help you simplify the design of your WordPress site

>**Swifty Site Designer**   
>*1 THEME. 1 MILLION DESIGNS.*
> 
>Imagine a website as a collection of areas. Such as the topbar, header, sidebar, and footer. This tool allows you to define the size, background, position and styling of each of those areas. The combinations are endless. You have maximum freedom to create any design. That’s why Swifty Site Designer is not an ordinary theme. It’s more like a theme generator.
>
>**Pick one of the sample designs.**   
>*THEN TWEAK IT TO PERFECTION.*
>
>The possible combinations are mind-bending. But not to worry. We’ll get you started with dozens of inspirational designs. Just pick one you like and start modifying. From the color and font, you want to use for your headlines to the position of the navigation menu and the size and background of the footer.
>
>**Mix and Match**   
>*LAYOUT. STYLE. COLORS.*
>
>Inside you will find  a lot of different layouts. Both boxed and wide. Pick one you like and apply different styles to it. Like what you see? Move on to the colors and choose one of the color pallets. See what happens when you click through the different color schemes. Almost right? But not quite? Just use the color picker or paste your own color code to make it just right.
>
>**Beautiful images**   
>*USE OURS. OR YOUR OWN.*
>
>Swifty Site Designer comes packed with images. Both big ones for your header and small ones you can use as a background pattern in any area. It even comes with a built-in pattern generator. Just pick a pattern you like and then pick two custom colors to generate the exact right look. Stripes. Dots. Flowers.
> 
>You name it. We’ve got it.
>
>**SEO friendly**   
>*WE’VE DONE ALL THE HARD WORK.*   
>*SO YOU DON’T HAVE TO.*
>
>Under the hood, Swifty sites are remarkably well optimized for stellar performance in the search engines. Clever use of modern technology ensures that the websites you create will do very well in Google. When your content is up to par, **it’s not uncommon to reach Google Page Speeds of 97%.**
>
>**Extra goodies**   
>*DELIVERED TO YOU DIRECTLY FROM OUR SERVERS.*
>
>There is only so much we are allowed to put in the zip file of the theme. And we have so many extra layouts, styles, fonts and sample designs that we want to give you. For free. That’s why we ask your permission to contact our servers to deliver you the goods.

####This is how we help you simplify creating and managing the pages of your WordPress site

>**Swifty Page Manager**  
>*MANAGE YOUR WORDPRESS PAGES. LIKE A BOSS.*
> 
>WordPress handles the pages of your website like blog posts. You can order them alphabetically, by date, by author or by number of responses. Nice for blog posts. Not so much for website pages. Swifty Page Manager shows you how the pages of your WordPress site are positioned and related to each other in a clear page tree overview.
> 
>**Add. Move. Remove.**   
>*MAKE SENSE OF YOUR WORDPRESS PAGES AGAIN.*
> 
>Add a new page and drag-and-drop it in the right position. Need to delete a page? Just click the trash bin icon and you’re done. Made a mistake? No worries. You can always get it back from the trash bin.
> 
>**Basic page settings**   
>*EASY ACCESS TO WHAT YOU NEED MOST*
> 
>When you add a page, just give it a short name. This will appear in the main navigation menu of your site. Then give it a title. That’s the short line of text that will appear blue in Google. Very important to put the main keyword in there.
> 
>**Advanced page settings**   
>*SOME EXTRA’S. WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.*
> 
>Neatly tucked away behind the “More” button you will find things like the page URL. It is generated automatically. But if you want, you can change the so-called 'slug' here. And you can change the status from draft to published and back.
> 
>**Built-in navigation**   
>*YOUR PAGE-TREE IS YOUR SITE’S NAVIGATION MENU*
> 
>Normally in WP you create pages in one spot. And then define the menu somewhere else. Mistakes are easily made. It’s easy to forget to add a new page to the site menu. But not with Swifty Page Manager. Because Swifty Site Designer makes sure your site menu is exactly what your page tree overview looks like.
> 
>**Now you see me.**   
>**Now you don’t.**   
>*SHOW OR HIDE A PAGE IN THE NAVIGATION MENU.*
> 
>Swifty Page Manager works closely together with the Swifty Site Designer theme. That enables you to create a page for the whole world to see. But also to hide that page from your menu. This is especially helpful for landing pages. You know, when you advertise on facebook or Google and you want the people to ‘land’ on a special page.
> 
>**Touch-friendly navigation**   
>*OPTIMIZED SITE MENU FOR MOBILE DEVICES.*
> 
>There is a special interaction between Swifty Page Manager and the Swifty Site Designer Theme. If you have both, you can decide how your menu should behave. On mobile, one tap on a main menu item opens the submenu. Lot’s of visitors don’t realize they have to tap the main menu item again if they want to go there. This could potentially mean that one of your most important pages does not get the number of visitors it deserves. We solve this problem by adding an extra button at the top of the submenu. This button has the same name as the main menu item by default. And on click goes there. In the Page Manager, however, you can change the name of this button.
> 
>**Area management**   
>*CREATE YOUR OWN PAGE TYPES*
> 
>There is also a special interaction between Swifty Page Manager and the [Swifty Content Creator Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/swifty-content-creator/). If you have both, you can decide – per page – which area’s of that page, such as the header, the footer or the navigation bar, need to be shown or hidden. This allows you to create special types of pages. Like a landing page. A blog page. Or a product page.
> 
>**Copy-paste**   
>*CREATE THE PERFECT PAGE. THEN RE-USE IT AS OFTEN AS YOU LIKE.*
> 
>A huge time saver is the ability to make a copy of an entire page. For certain parts of your site, like your blog or your product pages, you may want to use the same type of page layout every time. Just create it once. And then re-use it for the next one. Told ya. Super powers are up for grabs ;-)

####This is how we help you create stunningly beautiful pages for your WordPress site

>**Swifty Content Creator**   
>*SEE YOUR SITE AS YOUR VISITORS SEE IT.*   
>*WHILE YOU’RE EDITING.*
>
>**We let your site be the hero**   
>*OUR EDITOR IS POWERFUL.*   
>*YET HUMBLE.*
>
>Because it's main user interface is located at the bottom of your screen. This allows your site to be the hero. And for you to work free of distractions. There are no popups in which you type your text. You no longer have to switch back and forth between edit mode and preview mode to see the effect of what you are creating.
>
>You can simply type, or drag-and-drop stuff, in the page. And actually, see what you are doing. The way your visitors will see it.
>
>**Fully Responsive**   
>*WE MAKE YOUR SITE LOOK GOOD.*   
>*ON ANY DEVICE.*
>
>Google not only loves but requires websites to be responsive. Otherwise, they won’t even show your site in mobile search results. So content created with Swifty Content Creator is responsive by default. And if your theme is responsive as well, you’re good to go. Your site visitors will love it.
> 
>Your site looks great. You look great.
>
>**The Grid**   
>*USE ROWS AND COLUMNS TO POSITION YOUR CONTENT.*
> 
>Like many other front-end editors, you can use rows and columns to create clear and compelling layouts. Insert them and drag-and-drop them anywhere on the page. You can even copy-paste a column or an entire row. Now you get results fast.
>
>**Put your content in (con)text**   
>*HAVE YOUR TEXT WRAP BEAUTIFULLY AROUND ANY TYPE OF CONTENT ELEMENT.*
> 
>If text is the hero on your page, let it wrap naturally around any content element. A video. A quote. A Slider. Much in the same way text wraps around images.
> 
>You see, you *can* use a grid if you like, but you don’t *have* to.
>
>**Content Templates**   
>*CLEVER PREFAB CONTENT COMBINATIONS THAT MAKE YOU LOOK LIKE A PRO.*
> 
>Content Templates are smart combinations of content elements, positioned in rows and columns. Created by our designers to have an immediate impact on your pages. And huge time savers too. Columns with icons. Meet-the-team. And even those beautiful break-out bars that span the full width of the screen. Just insert them with a click of your mouse. Then edit them to make them your own.
>
>**Full page layouts**   
>*ONE CLICK. ONE PAGE.*
> 
>We call them Page Templates. Combinations of Content Templates that form full page layouts. Put together for you by our professional designers. They have done the creative part. You just pick a page preset you like and edit the content. Just the way you like it. 
>
We’ve got all kinds for you. Home pages. Landing pages. Contact pages. Product pages. And way – way more. Page Templates help you save time and help you create an amazing site. Even when you don’t feel very creative.
>
>**Auto-optimized images**   
>*UPLOAD AN IMAGE. DONE.*
>
>Imagine what life would be like if you could just upload an image – any image – to your website. And then forget about it. No need to resize before upload. No need to optimize. No need to pick the right size when you insert it into your content. Just upload an image and have Swifty take care of it. You can even just drag a corner to resize it. Don’t worry about it. We’ll show the exact right sized image to each individual website visitor. We even automatically tailor it to their screen size.
>
>**Unlimited WordPress Power**   
>*FULLY COMPATIBLE WITH WORDPRESS. BOTH WAYS.*
>
>Whatever you create in Swifty Content Creator can be edited in WordPress edit-mode. And whatever you edit in WordPress mode will still work in Swifty mode. So create most of the site the quick and easy way with Swifty Content Creator. And then add that special plugin or functionality the WordPress way. It all just works.
>
>**[Shortcodes]**  
>*WRITE TEXT. NOT CODE.*
>
>If you’ve ever worked with WordPress, you must have stumbled across them. Shortcodes. Those weird looking strings of code that suddenly show up while you are editing your page. They do all kinds of cool stuff for the website visitor. But behind the scenes, they can be pretty confusing. Swifty Content Creator lets you work in the front-end of your site. This means the effect of the shortcode is shown. Not the shortcode itself. Yes, it’s pretty awesome.
>
>**When you use the Swifty Site Designer Theme.**   
>*BEAUTIFUL THINGS TEND TO HAPPEN.*
>
>Swifty Content Creator is theme independent. And so it works with almost any theme. But it works especially well with its theme counterpart – Swifty Site Designer. Both part of the SwiftySite pack. And both take the approach that a web page consists of different areas, such as header, footer, and sidebar.
>
>Each area can have its own size, background, and position. And any area can have its own content, be shown or hidden on any page and can have different variants. Combine this with our Content Templates and Page Templates and see what happens.
>
>**Even more Features & Benefits**   
>*DISCOVER IN DETAIL WHAT SWIFTY CONTENT CREATOR CAN DO FOR YOU*
> 
>There is an extensive list of almost all the features loaded in Swifty Content Creator. Each is there for a reason. And each brings its own benefits. [Click and learn more about all the features](https://www.swifty.online/swiftysite/swifty-content-creator/features/)
